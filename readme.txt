This is a dunmpling restuarant.
I also like it because it's really cheap.
It's only a small restuarant and there is no decoration apart from a few ornaments behind the counter.
The neighborhood is great too.
Another great thing is you can get food served without having to wait.
So that you can walk right in and start eating.
But that's part of its charm.
